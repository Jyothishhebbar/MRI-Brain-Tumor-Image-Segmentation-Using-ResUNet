# MRI-Brain-Tumor-Image-Segmentation-Using-ResUNet
This repository implements ResUNet for brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. It combines U-Netâ€™s segmentation with residual connections for improved accuracy. Trained on the LGG MRI Segmentation Dataset, it provides an automated solution for tumor detection and treatment planning.
